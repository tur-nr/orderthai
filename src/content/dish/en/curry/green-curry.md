Thai Green Curry is a vibrant and aromatic dish bursting with flavour. Made with
a base of green curry paste, coconut milk, and fragrant herbs such as lemongrass,
galangal, and kaffir lime leaves, this curry offers a perfect balance of spicy,
sweet, and creamy notes.

It typically includes tender pieces of chicken or other proteins, along with
vegetables like Thai eggplant, bamboo shoots, and bell peppers, creating a
colourful and satisfying meal.

Served with steamed rice, Thai green curry is a beloved classic in Thai cuisine,
cherished for its bold flavours and comforting warmth.
